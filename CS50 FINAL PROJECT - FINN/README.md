#### Description:
The **CS50 Finn's Pomodoro** is a comprehensive time management application that implements the Pomodoro Technique, a popular method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. This technique encourages users to break their work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. By focusing on concentrated work followed by rest, the Pomodoro Technique aims to improve productivity and maintain mental freshness.

## Overview of the Application
The CS50 Finn's Pomodoro application has been designed to help users effectively manage their time while working on tasks, studying, or engaging in any activities that require focus. It integrates several key features that enhance user experience and productivity:

### 1. Dynamic Timer
The core functionality of the application is its dynamic timer. Users can easily select their preferred durations for work sessions (Pomodoros) and breaks (short and long breaks). The timer is visually appealing and updates in real-time, allowing users to stay informed of their progress.

- **Customizable Intervals**: Users can set their desired time intervals based on their personal preferences. For instance, they might choose to work for 25 minutes and take a 5-minute break, or opt for longer sessions as they see fit.
- **Countdown Display**: The countdown timer is prominently displayed on the main screen, making it easy for users to monitor the remaining time in their current session.
